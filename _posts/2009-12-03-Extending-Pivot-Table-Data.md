Python and Excel can help you quickly clean up a spreadsheet, organize
data, and build useful reports in very few lines of code. Another
helpful data preparation technique is to make new columns of
information based on the available data. This post discusses how you
can use Python to extend your Excel data and create more meaningful
reports.

<!--end_excerpt-->

Excel does provide a function for calculating new values within a pivot table. One example is extending a pivot table containing pricing and quantity data to compute an average selling price. For example, given the table below:

![Sales by Quarter](/assets/images/20091203_salesbyqtr.png)

a new label called “ASP”, which is the Net Booking divided by the Quantity, can
be added quickly and easily with Excel’s Calculated Field capability.

This feature is handy for adding labels on the fly that require a simple
calculation.

In other cases, deriving the new field may not be so simple, yet needs to be
performed each time the spreadsheet is updated. Python can programmatically add
new data fields to the source table so that the data is ready for viewing
whenever the pivot table is opened.

The script developed in the [last post]({% post_url
2009-11-23-Automating-Pivot-Tables-with-Python %}) automated the data
cleanup and pivot table generation tasks. Doing some further analysis
based on the output spreadsheet, I created a chart of the Top 10
Customers for ABCD Catering:

![Top 10 Customers Chart](/assets/images/20091203_top10chart.png)

Note that some of the company names are 15 characters or longer and
occupy much of the chart space. It would be nice to have a shorter
logo name for each company that could be used in the charts. One
solution is to cut and paste the pivot table data, then modify the
Company Name information by hand. Unfortunately, this would be very
tedious. Another approach is to automate the process in the script and
create a new column derived from a comprehensive reference table of
full company names and shorter logo names. The downside is that
maintaining the list could be an issue as the business grows and the
list of customers grows longer. A third method is to create an
algorithm that uses the first word in the company name wherever
possible and uses a defined nickname for other special cases. “Sun
Microsystems” becomes “Sun” and “Cisco Systems” becomes “Cisco”, while
other company names such as “Hewlett-Packard” could be listed in a
lookup with a nickname such as “HP”. The snippet below shows how this
is done.

```python
logolookup = {'Applied Materials':  'AMAT',
              'Electronic Arts':    'EA',
              'Hewlett-Packard':    'HP',
              'KLA-Tencor':         'KLA'}
if ("Company Name" in newdata[0]):
    cindx = newdata[0].index("Company Name")
    newdata[0][cindx+1:cindx+1] = ["Logo Name"]
    for rcnt in range(1, len(newdata)):
        if newdata[rcnt][cindx] in logolookup:
            newdata[rcnt][cindx+1:cindx+1] = [logolookup[newdata[rcnt][cindx]]]
        else:
            newname = newdata[rcnt][cindx].split()[0]
            newdata[rcnt][cindx+1:cindx+1] = [newname]
            logolookup[newdata[rcnt][cindx]] = newname
```

This code begins with a simple lookup for company names and can be easily
extended as special case company names are added. Next, the column location of
the “Company Name” field is identified and the new header “Logo Name” is
inserted after “Company Name” in the list using the `` list[index:index]``
construct. The ``for`` loop iterates over each row in the table, checking
whether the company name for that row exists in the ``logolookup``
dictionary, then inserting the abbreviated name. If not found, then the original
company name is ``split()`` into words and the first word used as the new
abbreviated name. Finally, the ``logolookup`` dictionary is updated with
the new abbreviated name.

After running the program, the new column “Logo Name” has been inserted after
“Company Name” and contains the shortened company names.

![Company Name and Logo Name](/assets/images/20091203_withlogo.png)

The new “Logo Name” column can be used in the previous pivot table and chart,
replacing the “Company Name” field and producing a cleaner chart with less area
used for displaying company name information.

Another use of this technique is to add a label for “Food Category” based on the
type of food purchased. For example, the food items sold by ABCD Catering are:
Caesar Salad, Cheese Pizza, Cheeseburger, Chocolate Sundae, Churro, Hamburger,
Hot Dog, Pepperoni Pizza, Potato Chips and Soda. Let’s say that your manager
wants to track the sales of different food categories, such as Burger, Dessert,
HotDog, Drink, Pizza, Salad and Snack. Using the same technique outlined above,
this code will add a column for Food Category with the appropriate entry for
each food item:

```python
foodlookup = {'Caesar Salad':     'Salad',
              'Cheese Pizza':     'Pizza',
              'Cheeseburger':     'Burger',
              'Chocolate Sundae': 'Dessert',
              'Churro':           'Snack',
              'Hamburger':        'Burger',
              'Hot Dog':          'HotDog',
              'Pepperoni Pizza':  'Pizza',
              'Potato Chips':     'Snack',
              'Soda':             'Drink'}
if ("Food Name" in newdata[0]):
    cindx = newdata[0].index("Food Name")
    newdata[0][cindx+1:cindx+1] = ["Food Category"]
    for rcnt in range(1, len(newdata)):
        if newdata[rcnt][cindx] in foodlookup:
            newdata[rcnt][cindx+1:cindx+1] = [foodlookup[newdata[rcnt][cindx]]]
        else:
            newdata[rcnt][cindx+1:cindx+1] = ['UNDEFINED']
```

If a food item is not found in the lookup, the category is labeled UNDEFINED.
This is an indication that there is a problem with the script and the lookup for
food categories needs to be extended.

The section of the script which creates the pivot tables can be easily extended
to build a new table based on the newly created label “Food Category”:

```python
# What food category had the highest unit sales in Q4?
ptname = addpivot(wb, src,
                  title="Unit Sales by Food Category",
                  filters=("Fiscal Quarter",),
                  columns=(),
                  rows=("Food Category",),
                  sumvalue="Sum of Quantity",
                  sortfield=("Food Category",win32c.xlDescending))
wb.Sheets("Unit Sales by Food Category").PivotTables(ptname).PivotFields("Fiscal Quarter").CurrentPage = "2009-Q4"
```

Based on the output spreadsheet, the best selling food category in Q4 based on
quantity is “Snack”, with sales of 13700 units.
