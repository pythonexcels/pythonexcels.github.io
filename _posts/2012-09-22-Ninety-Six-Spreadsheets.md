Here’s another application for Python and Excel: opening a folder of
spreadsheets and pulling specific data from each spreadsheet.

As a part-time bookkeeper for my wife’s restaurant, I needed to review
the history of raises for a couple of her employees. Unfortunately,
the actual pay rate was spread across 96 different spreadsheets
representing almost four years of pay history. A typical payroll
sheet looks like this:

![payroll](/assets/images/20191005_payroll_spreadsheet.png)

To manually click through each spreadsheet, locate the pay rate for
Steve and Jeff, write it down, and go to the next spreadsheet
would take about 30 seconds per spreadsheet. Instead of spending
almost 50 minutes opening and closing spreadsheets, I decided to
invest 10 minutes in a Python script I could use over and over.

The script opens every .xlsx file in the local directory and extracts
the list of employee names from column B. If either Steve or Jeff is
found in the list, their salary is recorded. After all the
spreadsheets are read, the script prints out the results. The
spreadsheets are named “2012-01-01-Payroll.xlsx” for January 1, 2012,
“2012-01-15-Payroll.xlsx” for January 15, 2012, and so on.

The brief example on Github contains two spreadsheets: 2012-01-01-Payroll.xlsx and 2012-01-15-Payroll.xlsx. The script opens these files, extracts payrates for Jeff and Steve, and writes the payrates to jeffsteve.csv as shown below:

The completed script is available at [https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/blob/master/payrates.py](https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/blob/master/payrates.py). The sample spreadsheets are available at [https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/raw/master/Payroll/2012-01-01-Payroll.xlsx](https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/raw/master/Payroll/2012-01-01-Payroll.xlsx) and [https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/raw/master/Payroll/2012-01-15-Payroll.xlsx](https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/raw/master/Payroll/2012-01-15-Payroll.xlsx) if you'd like to test the script yourself.

```python
#
# payrates.py
# Report payrates for two employees across multiple spreadsheets
#
import win32com.client as win32
import glob
import os

xlxsfiles = sorted(glob.glob("*.xlsx"))
print ("Reading %d files..."%len(xlxsfiles))

steve = []
jeff = []
cwd = os.getcwd()
excel = win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')
fpjeffsteve = open('jeffsteve.csv', 'w')
for xlsxfile in xlxsfiles:
    wb = excel.Workbooks.Open(cwd+"\\"+xlsxfile)
    try:
        ws = wb.Sheets('PAYROLL')
    except:
        print ("No sheet named 'PAYROLL' in %s, skipping"%xlsxfile)
        jeff.append(0.0)
        steve.append(0.0)
        wb.Close()
        continue
    xldata = ws.UsedRange.Value
    names = [r[1] for r in xldata]
    if u'SMITHFIELD, STEVE' in names:
        indx = names.index(u'SMITHFIELD, STEVE')
        steve.append(xldata[indx][4])
    else:
        steve.append(0)

    if u'JOHNSON, JEFF' in names:
        indx = names.index(u'JOHNSON, JEFF')
        jeff.append(xldata[indx][4])
    else:
        jeff.append(0)
    wb.Close()

fpjeffsteve.write ("File,Jeff,Steve\n")
for i in range(len(xlxsfiles)):
    fpjeffsteve.write ("%s,%0.2f,%0.2f\n"%(xlxsfiles[i], jeff[i], steve[i]))
print ("Wrote jeffsteve.csv")
excel.Application.Quit()
