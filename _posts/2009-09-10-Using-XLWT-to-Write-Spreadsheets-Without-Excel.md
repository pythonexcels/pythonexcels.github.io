Long before I even started thinking about writing a blog covering the
integration possibilities between Excel and Python, the folks at
[Simplistix](http://www.simplistix.co.uk) were crafting some of the
handiest Python modules around: xlrd, xlwt and xlutils.

Simplistix is no longer with us, but their page at
[http://www.simplistix.co.uk](http://www.simplistix.co.uk) provides links to their GitHub repos.
These fantastic modules enable Python to directly read and write an
Excel .xls file without the need for Microsoft Excel. Not only can you
insert numbers and text, but xlwt supports a multitude of formatting
options. There’s even a great set of documentation and a Google group
monitored by the maintainers. You can find out more about these
modules at [http://www.python-excel.org](http://www.python-excel.org)

## Installation

For Python versions 2.6 and later, you can install xlwt with the `pip`
utility. Open a Windows command window and run `pip install xlwt` as
follows:

```shell
C:\> python --version
Python 3.7.3

C:> pip install xlwt

Successfully installed xlwt-1.3.0
```

## Using xlwt

I’ve written a fair number of Python scripts that interface with Excel
through the Windows COM interface, but for many tasks you don’t need
to invoke Excel to operate on spreadsheet data. The Simplistix
utilities provide an excellent way of interfacing with Excel
spreadsheets for many routine jobs.

In my example below, I format a raw text file containing information
on reference account categories for a hospital (based on data from
data.gov):

```
09700RESEARCH
09800PHYSICIANS  PRIVATE OFFICES
09900NONPAID WORKERS
MANAGEMENT FEES
REFERENCE LABS
```

The raw data is smashed together, with the account number and category
abutted without separation. Some of the data doesn’t even have an
account number. Based on the input above, the goal is to produce Excel
output like this:

![Excel output](/assets/images/20090910_1.png)

To create this output, the script does the following:

* Separates the account number and name
* Assigns an account number of 99999 and sets the cell color to red for
unnumbered accounts
* Converts the account name to a properly capitalized name
* Removes any extra spaces in the account name
* Writes the account number and name into two separate columns in the spreadsheet
* Formats the column width of each spreadsheet column based on the width of the
widest data

Since there are no charts, pivot tables, or other fancy formatting
needed, xlwt is perfect for the job. Here is the script that performs
the conversion, available at
[xlwt_hospdata.py](https://github.com/pythonexcels/xlwt/blob/master/xlwt_hospdata.py)

```python
import sys
import re
from xlwt import Workbook, easyxf


def doxl():
    '''Read raw account number and name strings, separate the data and
       write to an excel spreadsheet.  Properly capitalize the account
       names and mark cells with no account number as 99999 with red fill
       '''
    try:
        fp = open("hospdata.txt")
    except:
        print('Failed to open hospdata.txt')
        sys.exit(1)
    lines = fp.readlines()

    nameandnum = re.compile(r'(\d+)\s*(.*)\s*')
    wb = Workbook()
    wsraw = wb.add_sheet('Raw Data')
    ws = wb.add_sheet('Account List')
    ws.write(0, 0, 'Account Number')
    ws.write(0, 1, 'Account Name')
    ws.col(0).width = len('Account Number') * 256
    ws.col(1).width = max([len(line) for line in lines]) * 256
    r = 1

    for line in lines:
        wsraw.write(r, 0, line.strip())
        m = nameandnum.match(line)
        if m:
            ws.write(r, 0, int(m.group(1)))
            ws.write(r, 1, ' '.join([w.capitalize() for w in m.group(2).split()]))
        else:
            ws.write(r, 0, 99999, easyxf('pattern: pattern solid, fore_colour red;'))
            ws.write(r, 1, ' '.join([w.capitalize() for w in line.split()]))
        r += 1
    wb.save('accounts.xls')
    print('Wrote accounts.xls')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    doxl()
```

Before running this example, you must have xlwt installed as described
in the [Installation](#installation) section above. Let’s look at the
important bits in the script above.

The following lines 12-17:

```python
    try:
        fp = open("hospdata.txt")
    except:
        print('Failed to open hospdata.txt')
        sys.exit(1)
    lines = fp.readlines()
```

attempt to open the file hospdata.txt. If successful, the file contents are read
into “lines” as a list of strings. Next, line 19

```python
nameandnum = re.compile(r'(\d+)\s*(.*)\s*')
```

creates a compiled regular expression used to parse each line. This regular
expression extracts an account number and account name from the string. It’s
assumed that the account numbers can only contain digits, and the account names
cannot begin with a digit. The compiled regular expression is used later to
attempt a match on each line in the input file.

The next section (lines 20-26) creates a new workbook with two worksheets:

```python
wb = Workbook()
wsraw = wb.add_sheet('Raw Data')
ws = wb.add_sheet('Account List')
ws.write(0,0,'Account Number')
ws.write(0,1,'Account Name')
ws.col(0).width = len('Account Number') * 256
ws.col(1).width = max([len(line) for line in lines]) * 256
```

The two worksheets are named “Raw Data” and “Account List” and are
used to store the unprocessed and processed data. The headings
“Account Number” and “Account Name” are written to the first row of
the Account List worksheet. To set the column width, the length of the
longest string in each column is multiplied by 256 to calculate the
setting. Referring to the documentation for xlwt, you’ll see that the
column width setting is based on the width of the 0 character for the
first font in the list, not the default font, so you may want to fine
tune the calculation to make the column width setting slightly wider
than the actual data.

The next section (lines 29 through 37) iterates over each line of the
text file:

```python
for line in lines:
    wsraw.write(r,0,line.strip())
    m = nameandnum.match(line)
    if m:
        ws.write(r, 0, int(m.group(1)))
        ws.write(r, 1, ' '.join([w.capitalize() for w in m.group(2).split()]))
    else:
        ws.write(r, 0, 99999, easyxf('pattern: pattern solid, fore_colour red;'))
        ws.write(r, 1, ' '.join([w.capitalize() for w in line.split()]))
```

The raw data is written to the Raw Data sheet, then the line is matched against
the regular expression. If the match is successful, the number part is written
to the first column, and the text is written to the second column. The following
statement in line 35:

```python
' '.join([w.capitalize() for w in m.group(2).split()])
```

splits account name information into individual words, capitalizes
each word, then reassembles the string with a space between each word.
If you wanted to insert the account name string as-is, you would
simply replace the statement above with the following:

```python
m.group(2)
```

If no match occurs, then the string might not contain an account
number. The script assumes that the whole string contains the account
name only and a dummy account number of 99999 is inserted. In
addition, the cell background is changed to a red color to flag the
text for quick visual scanning.

After all input lines are processed, the accounts.xls file is written
and the following message is printed by the following lines:

```python
wb.save('accounts.xls')
print('Wrote accounts.xls')
```

The completed accounts.xls spreadsheet looks like this, with account
number and name split into two columns and with a reformatted account
name string:
