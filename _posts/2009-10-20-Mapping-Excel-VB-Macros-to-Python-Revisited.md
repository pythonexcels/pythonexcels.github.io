The last post introduced a technique for recording a Visual Basic
macro within Excel and porting it to Python. This exercise will build
on those techniques while leveraging Python for more of the work. In
this example, you will create two tables from scratch — a simple
multiplication table and a table of random numbers — and apply
conditional formatting to the numbers.

<!--end_excerpt-->

## Building the Complete Multiplication Table

To begin, start the IDLE tool and run the following commands to
initialize the worksheet.

```python
import win32com.client as win32
excel = win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')
excel.Visible = True
wb = excel.Workbooks.Add()
ws = wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')
```

After typing these commands in IDLE, you’ll see an Excel window with an
empty spreadsheet. To build the multiplication table, begin by
populating the column and row headers. There are several ways to
do this; for this exercise, you’ll pass a list of column header and
a list of row header values to Excel. A row of data is defined by using the
``ws.Range().Value`` statement with a list or tuple on the right hand
side of the equals sign. Rather than explicitly defining the list as
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, you can use Python’s list
comprehension with a `range()` statement to populate the values as
follows:

```python
[i for i in range(1, 11)]
```

The complete statement is ``ws.Range("B2:K2").Value =
[i for i in range(1,11)]``. Defining a single column of data is a bit
trickier; you must define a list of single-element lists or tuples.
One way to do this is to use Python’s ``zip()`` function to transpose
the flat list into a list of tuples. The complete statement is
``ws.Range("B2:B11").Value = zip([i for i in range(1,11)])``. The
statements for completing the column and row headers are shown below.

```python
ws.Range("B2:K2").Value = [i for i in range(1, 11)]
ws.Range("B2:B11").Value = list(zip([i for i in range(1, 11)]))
```

At this point, your spreadsheet contains the column and row headers as follows:

![headersexcel1](/assets/images/20190929_headersexcel1.png)

To define the product values for each cell in the table, create a
formula to multiply the column and row header for a single cell, then
use Excel to autofill the remaining cells. Looking at the spreadsheet,
the product for cell C3 is calculated by multiplying cell B3 by cell C2.
For Excel, the formula is ``=B3*C2``. To use Excel’s autofill
capability in later steps, you need to anchor the row and column in
the formula by prefixing it with the $ character. In other words, the
formula you want to use is ``=$B3*C$2``. Once that formula is entered,
the remaining cells can be filled in two steps. First,
programmatically select the cell and drag it fill the row. Next,
select the newly autofilled row and drag the new row down to fill in
the remaining rows. Since this was demonstrated in the last post,
please refer to that post if you need more information. The equivalent
Python code to implement the autofill is shown below.

```python
ws.Range("C3").Formula = "=$B3*C$2"
ws.Range("C3:C3").Select()
excel.Selection.AutoFill(ws.Range("C3:K3"),win32.constants.xlFillDefault)
ws.Range("C3:K3").Select()
excel.Selection.AutoFill(ws.Range("C3:K11"),win32.constants.xlFillDefault)
```

The spreadsheet now contains the complete multiplication table.

## Adding Conditional Formatting

Now let’s add conditional formatting to the spreadsheet. Conditional
formatting applies a color to individual cells based on the value of
the cell, and helps you to spot outliers or discrepancies in a table
of values.

Continuing with the same spreadsheet, we will create a second table of
random integers between 1 and 100. Excel’s ``RAND()`` function will
generate a random number between 0 and 1; to scale the values we'll
use the formula ``=INT(RAND()*100)``. The ``ws.Range().Formula``
method can be used to fill a range with the same formula. The
following code creates the table of random integers.

```python
ws.Range("B13:K22").Formula = "=INT(RAND()*100)"
```

The Excel spreadsheet should now contain both the multiplication and
random number tables.

![randomtable](/assets/images/20190929_randomtable.png)

Now you can apply conditional formatting to the multiplication table
and the random table. Even though you invoked Excel from Python, you
still can manipulate the spreadsheet using the Excel interface, and
even record macros. Click “Record Macro” in the Developer tab to begin
recording your macro to apply conditional formatting.

Select all the cells in the range B2:K22; both tables are included in
the selection. In the Home tab, select Conditional Formatting->Color
Scales->Red-Yellow-Blue Color Scale. If you can’t find the
Red-Yellow-Blue Color Scale, choose another scale.

The spreadsheet should now show a color background for each of the
selected cells with a value. Next, select columns B through K and set
the column width to 4. Finally, select cell A1 and stop the macro by
clicking “Stop Recording” in the Developer tab.

Your spreadsheet now has conditional formatting and will look
something like this, with cells containing numbers near 100 colored in
Red, cells with a value of 50 in Yellow, and cells with a value of 1
in Blue, with a shade of these colors for values in between:

![conditionalformatting](/assets/images/20190929_conditionalformatting.png)

As an aside, you can update the random numbers in the lower table by hitting the
F9 key to force Excel to reapply the formulas in the spreadsheet and calculate
new random values.

To continue, open the macro just created by selecting Macros from the Developer
tab, select the name of the macro you just captured and click Edit. The macro
should look something like this:

```vbnet
Sub Macro1()
'
' Macro1 Macro
'
    Range("B2:K22").Select
    Selection.FormatConditions.AddColorScale ColorScaleType:=3
    Selection.FormatConditions(Selection.FormatConditions.Count).SetFirstPriority
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).Type = _
        xlConditionValueLowestValue
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
        .Color = 13011546
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).Type = _
        xlConditionValuePercentile
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).Value = 50
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).FormatColor
        .Color = 8711167
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(3).Type = _
        xlConditionValueHighestValue
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(3).FormatColor
        .Color = 7039480
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Range("A1").Select
End Sub
```

Though the macro contains some very long method names and some ``With``
statements, the porting is straightforward. Here are some guidelines
to keep in mind while migrating this code to Python:

* `Selection` is preceded by ``excel.``

Remember that ``Selection`` is a method at the Excel Application level, you need to
precede it with ``excel``. in this example.

* Range is preceded by ``ws``

``Range`` is a method at the Worksheet level, which is defined earlier as `ws.` in
this example.

* Function calls require ``()`` in Python

Unlike VB, any function calls must be followed by ``()`` in Python.

* ``With`` statements must be expanded

The three ``With`` blocks in this macro need to be expanded, which can
be done with temporary variables or by copying the statement following
the ``With`` keyword. For example, the first ``With`` block:

```vbnet
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
    .Color = 13011546
    .TintAndShade = 0
End With
```

can be written in Python as

```python
excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor.Color = 13011546
excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor.TintAndShade = 0
```

or by using a temporary variable as

```python
x = excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
x.Color = 13011546
x.FormatColor.TintAndShade = 0
```

or by using `with` as

```python
with excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor as fc:
    fc.Color = 13011546
    fc.FormatColor.TintAndShade = 0
```

Temporary variables were created to make the script more concise. In
particular, the statement ``[csc1, csc2, csc3] =
[excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(n) for n in
range(1, 4)]`` was used to create three temporary variables for the
three `ColorScaleCriteria` methods.

To save the spreadsheet and close Excel, use the ``SaveAs`` and
``Quit`` methods as shown in the full script example.

Here is the complete conditionalformatting.py script. The line
``excel.Visible = True`` has been commented out. Unless you are
developing the script, you typically want Excel to run invisibly in
the background.
